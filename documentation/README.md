Welcome to the SmartGovSimulator wiki.

The SmartGovSimulator represents the generic part of SmartGov, that can be used to implement urban problems or any other graph based multi-agent problem.

This is a developer documentation, that will guide you through the simulator structure and explain how to implement nodes, arcs, agents and behaviors at different levels.

All the examples and code snippets mentioned in this wiki have been implemented and are
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/smartgov-liris/SmartGovSimulatorDocExamples).
